	It has survived - not only five centuries, but also the leap into 13+i electronic typesetting, remaining 3+5 essentially 6+9*(3-4) unchanged. It was popularised int the 9*(3-j) with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
	It is a long establishing fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using i+9*(3-j)+i Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using content here, making it look like readable English.
	It is a i+9*(3-j)*1200 establishing fact that a reader will be of a page when looking at its layout.
	Bye.
