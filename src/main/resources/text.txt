    I like going to restaurants at the weekend very much. If my friends come along with me, then I book a table for two or more people.
    In my city there different kinds of restaurants – Indian, French, Chinese and so on. I prefer oriental cuisine, so I can often be found in Japanese restaurants. Probably everyone is aware of the most signature dish of the Japanese – there is no doubt that it is sushi. Most of my comrades do not like sushi and when I am going to make my way definitely for a Japanese restaurant, they refuse to go there with me.
    Nevertheless, I do not get upset and do not give myself up to despair because of loneliness. On the contrary – I get a chance to sit in silence for a while, listen to oriental music and taste one of the specials.
    Waiters in the Japanese restaurant are very obliging. At the beginning they hand me the menu for 10-15 minutes so that I might study it well. I adore sweets, therefore I always order some dessert. A waiter takes my order and after a while he serves me the dessert. At the end I pay for the dinner and leave some tip.
